 This repository contains implementation of basic Machine Learning algorithms in some popular  machine learning and data science problems in python.
   It so far has python notebook implementation of the following data science problems:
   1. Titanic Survival classification (using Logistic Regression)
   2. Adult Income classification (using Neural Network)
   3. Spam SMS filtering (using Multinomial Naive Bayes)
   4. Spooky Author Identification - Kaggle Competition (using Multinomial Naive Bayes)
